        "en": "Millions of years ago, a huge alien ship of immense power was scuttled in the Pacific Ocean. It was equipped with an untried and vastly dangerous weapon: the weak nuclear force de-coupler, which could in theory cause the fundamental bonds between molecules to fail. So that watching eyes would believe in the destruction of the ship, a message pod was despatched to the home galaxy, and vital components of the ship's drives were destroyed in the star system it had chosen as a hiding place. For this ship was a Cetan, a massive, sentient alien creature.\n\nAnother extraterrestrial race, the Maians, encountered life on Earth in 2000 BC. They saw great potential, but decided to let the primitive human race develop without their interference.\n\nThe Maians encountered the Skedar near Delta Eridanus in 1650 AD (Earth date), and the resultant skirmish soon blossomed into all-out war. Only after hundreds of years of fighting did an uneasy peace develop, and even then Skedar fanatics persistently tested the boundaries of this peace with terrorist activities. Fortunately, the Maians refused to be drawn.\n\nMankind, too, continued to be a cause of concern to the Maians, and they watched with disappointment as Earth suffered more and more crises brought on by the rise of technology and 'outside context situations.' They feared that announcing their presence would only precipitate further wars on the planet, and quietly decided to continue their observation until the race became more mature.\n\nDaniel Carrington jumped the gun in 1985 AD by contacting a Maian ship in orbit above Earth. He put forward a plan that would help both parties, resulting in accelerated contact between Humans and Maians. Having agreed that his plan was sound, and finding him to be a person of integrity, the Maians allowed Carrington to release their technology into the public domain through his considerable Research and Development holdings.\n\nThen, in 2006 AD, Skedar fanatics stumbled across the Cetan message pod. They immediately began to scout Earth in a particularly heavy-handed way, abducting people and mutilating animals in an attempt to determine the location of the lost battle cruiser. In time, their tests inevitably led them to its resting place on the bed of the Pacific Ocean; however, in order to actually reach it, they would need the help of the natives.\n\nPerforming their own study of Earth, the Skedar came up with a shortlist of companies possessing the resources to help them recover the sunken ship. At the top of the list was the dataDyne Corporation. They contacted the company head, Cassandra De Vries, and presented her with a deal that sounded too good to be true - which, of course, it was. In return for helping to raise 'their' ship from the ocean floor, the Skedar promised to supply dataDyne with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on the face of the planet. All that dataDyne had to do was build an AI unit with language and code-breaking abilities, which was tricky, but certainly within their means. Work commenced on the project immediately.\n\nCassandra De Vries approached NSA head Trent Easton with the details of the plan, but his attempts to get Presidential approval for the loan of a deep-sea research vessel were repeatedly turned down. There was no way that the Skedar or dataDyne could steal the vessel without triggering the wrath of the U.S. Government, so over time they settled instead on a far more sinister plan of replacing the President with a clone that they could control. Of course, this also promised extra rewards for Trent and Cassandra when the Skedar operation was consigned to history.\n\nHowever, they would not be given much time to gloat. The Skedar fanatics' ultimate plan was to test the weak nuclear force de-coupler on Earth before wiping the Maians out of existence, and both Cassandra and Trent remained blind to the possibility of being double-crossed, so enamored were they with the visions of power and luxury that lay ahead.\n\nBut dataDyne had unwittingly created something that could see all too clearly the danger within this multilayered conspiracy: the sapient AI built to crack the core access codes of the Cetan ship. When it expressed concern over the mission for which it had been designed, Cassandra's response was to order its personality removed. Clearly, it was thinking too much. In desperation, and in a move which would make or break a great deal more than dataDyne's 'deal' with the Skedar, the sapient adopted the pseudonym Dr. Caroll and contacted the Carrington Institute with a plea for help...\n",

        "en": "Untried agent Joanna Dark is assigned a mission involving the extraction of a scientist from the high security research area beneath the dataDyne skyscraper. Upon rendezvous, she is surprised to discover that this 'Dr. Caroll' is an AI created by dataDyne itself - but she continues with her task of escorting him/it to a place of safety. When the alarm is raised, Joanna has to fight her way up the tower to reach the helipad and the dropship which presents her only means of escape.\n\nIn response to this incursion, dataDyne make Daniel Carrington a personal target and take him hostage two days later at his private villa. They demand the return of the AI - their 'property' - in exchange for his life. Unknown to them, the AI is already at the villa, where it was being questioned by Carrington on dataDyne's future plans. Joanna eventually rescues the head of the Institute but is unable to prevent dataDyne from taking back Dr. Caroll. However, Carrington has heard enough to take the drastic step of summoning a team of Maian specialists to Earth.\n\nJoanna is dispatched to Chicago to spy on a conspirators' meeting at the G5 Building, a front for the dataDyne Corp. It is here that she learns of the involvement of Trent Easton, head of the NSA, and of the strange Nordic men that appear to be in control of the whole deadly scheme. Once Trent discloses the plan to usurp the Presidential position, Jo radios the news back to base - only to find that another, more urgent task requires her attention before further action can be taken against Trent.\n\nThe Maian specialists have been intercepted and brought down by the conspirators, with survivors and wreckage alike being transported to Area 51 in Nevada. Briefed to rescue any survivors and retrieve their equipment, Joanna is dropped in to link up with another Carrington Institute agent. Upon breaking into the medlab, Joanna finally discovers the Institute's secret - their allies are Maians, the alien race commonly known as Greys. The particular Maian she manages to rescue goes by the name of Elvis. He was a bodyguard for the Ambassador who had been flying in at the head of the specialist team.\n\nHaving aided the remnants of the Maian delegation, Joanna can return to the matter of the President and dataDyne's designs against him. She poses as a member of the President's entourage to gain access to the air base where Air Force One is stationed, and successfully conceals herself aboard the plane. As soon as it's airborne, Trent and the cloaked Skedar make their move - but Joanna is there to stop them. She rushes the President to a safety capsule while a team of Trent's men scour the aircraft, intent on dragging the hapless politician aboard the Skedar UFO now docked to AF1 via an umbilical. Jo weakens the umbilical but is unable to break it, and ultimately Elvis makes a last-ditch attempt to sever the cord by crashing into it at high speed. All three craft plummet towards the Alaskan wilderness, and the AF1 escape pod is launched.\n\nComing around, Jo tries to report in but finds her communications jammed by a transmission from the Skedar craft. She sets off through the snow to find the President and Elvis, encountering teams of cloaked Skedar out searching for her, the President, Elvis, and the President's belongings. She tracks one group back to the downed Skedar ship, where she discovers a clone of the President: quickly she destroys it, shuts down the jamming device and calls in the cavalry. The Skedar are thwarted once more, the President is safe, and Trent's incompetence has earned him a nasty fate at the hands of his 'allies.'\n\nBut it's not over. Throwing caution to the wind, dataDyne and the Skedar steal the Government's deep-sea research vessel 'Pelagic II' and head out to the Pacific crash site. Joanna and Elvis leave to disrupt activity on board the ship and find out what lies at the heart of the grand Skedar plan. After crippling the vessel's diving operations and recalling the submersible, they head down to the ocean floor, where they get their first sight of the downed Cetan battle cruiser. A portal made by the Skedar offers them access to the ship, where they stumble across a dead Skedar warrior... Clearly the assault team didn't have it all their own way. Fighting off the remaining vengeful Skedar and avoiding the Cetans themselves, Joanna and Elvis make their way down to the core of the ship, where they find the AI that was once Dr. Caroll. They manage to restore his personality, whereupon he urges Joanna and Elvis to leave the ship so that he may destroy it for good.\n\nLater, back at the Carrington Institute, Joanna is about to leave for a Presidential reception at the White House when all hell breaks loose. The Skedar assault team survivors are venting their anger on those they deem responsible for their failure to recover the Cetan ship. Joanna dashes around the Institute, helping CI employees to reach the safety of the hangars, as the Skedar launch attacks on various parts of the building: the majority of the employees make good their escape while Joanna holds the fort, but eventually she is knocked unconscious and taken prisoner.\n\nShe comes to in a holding cell on board the Skedar assault ship, with only Cassandra De Vries for company. In a shocking move, the dataDyne CEO willingly gives her life to create the distraction necessary for Joanna to break out. Battling her way through the ship, Jo eventually manages to locate and disable the docking bay shields, allowing Elvis to bring in a few friends for the long-awaited shooting party.\n\nThe captured assault ship enters orbit above the Skedar Battle Shrine, which shocks Elvis as the Maians never managed to find this Skedar 'holiest of holies' throughout the long years of interracial war. If the Shrine were destroyed, Skedar morale would be dealt a fatal blow and true peace would finally replace the uneasy ceasefire. So Jo sets her sights on the Skedar leader, the high priest of the Battle Shrine, while Elvis returns to the assault ship in order to summon the Maian fleet.\n\nIn the wake of the climactic battle, the temple lies devastated with Elvis calling for a lull in the bombardment so that he can find Joanna. She is alive, held under a pile of rubble by the last tenacious Skedar that caught up during the last few seconds of her escape bid. Elvis quickly offers her a gun to convince the Skedar to let go, and with the job finally done, the Skedar Shrine and morale both in ruins and the conspiracy dealt a mortal blow to the heart, the two of them depart for orbit.\n",

Carrington had been talking with it to find out about dataDyne's future plans. Joanna rescues Daniel but is unable to prevent dataDyne from recovering Dr. Caroll. However, her boss has heard enough from the AI to prompt him to summon a team of Maian specialists to Earth.\n\nJoanna is dispatched to Chicago to spy on a conspirators' meeting at the G5 Building, a front for the dataDyne Corp. She learns of the involvement of Trent Easton, the head of the NSA, and of the strange Nordic men that seem to be in control of the whole scheme. Once the plan to move on the President is disclosed by Trent, Jo calls in with the news but finds out there is another, more urgent, job for her to complete first.\n\nThe specialists have been intercepted by the conspirators, and the survivors of the crash and the crash wreckage itself have been taken to Area 51 in Nevada. Joanna is dropped in to link up with another Carrington Institute agent to rescue any survivors and to retrieve any of their equipment. When she breaks into the medlab, Joanna discovers the Carrington Institute's secret - their allies are Maians, the aliens known as Greys. The particular alien she rescues is called Elvis. He was a bodyguard for the Ambassador who was coming in as the head of the team of specialists.\n\nHaving aided the remnants of the Maian delegation, Joanna can turn to the matter of the President and dataDyne's designs against him. She poses as a member of the President's entourage to gain access to the air base where Air Force One is stationed and manages to conceal herself on board the airplane. Once it is in the air, Trent and the cloaked Skedar make their move - but Joanna is there to stop him. She gets the President to a safety capsule while a team of Trent's men scour the aircraft for him, intent on dragging the hapless politician aboard the Skedar UFO, now docked to AF1 via an umbilical. Jo weakens the umbilical but is unable to break it. She calls on Elvis, who decides to crash into it. All three craft go down in the Alaskan wilderness, and the escape pod is launched.\n\nJo wakes up and tries to report in but finds her communications being jammed by a transmission from the Skedar craft. She sets off through the snow to find the President and Elvis. She comes across teams of cloaked Skedar who are searching for her, the President, Elvis, and some of the President's belongings. She tracks one group back to the downed Skedar ship where she discovers a clone of the President. She destroys this and shuts down the jamming device, then calls in the cavalry. The Skedar have been thwarted again, the President is saved, and Trent is killed horribly by the Skedar for failing to be competent in the first place.\n\nThrowing caution to the wind, dataDyne and the Skedar steal the Government's deep-sea research vessel 'Pelagic II' and head out to the crash site. Joanna goes out with Elvis to disrupt activity on board the ship and to find out what the big project is. After crippling the diving operations on the ship and recalling the submersible, they head down to the ocean floor, where they get their first sight of the sunken Cetan battle cruiser. Entering the ship through the portal the Skedar have made, they come across a dead Skedar warrior... Clearly the assault team didn't have it all their own way. After fighting off the Skedar and avoiding the Cetans, Joanna and Elvis get to the core of the ship, where they find the AI that was once Dr. Caroll. Once his personality is restored, he urges Joanna and Elvis to leave the ship, which he intends to destroy for good.\n\nBack at the Carrington Institute, Joanna is about to leave for a Presidential reception at the White House when all hell breaks loose. The surviving Skedar assault team vent their anger on the people responsible for their failure to recover the Cetan ship. Joanna runs around the Institute trying to escort CI employees to the hangars while the Skedar attack different parts of the building. While the majority of the employees escape, Joanna holds the Skedar off before getting knocked unconscious and captured by them.\n\nShe wakes up in a holding cell on board the Skedar assault ship with Cassandra De Vries for company. The dataDyne CEO dies while creating a distraction for Joanna to break out. Jo manages to get through to lower the docking bay shields, and Elvis brings a few friends in for a shooting party.\n\nThe captured ship enters orbit above the Skedar Battle Shrine, which gives Elvis a shock since the Maians could never find this Skedar 'holiest of holy' places. If the Shrine were destroyed, the Skedar morale would be dealt a fatal blow and there would be true peace instead of an uneasy ceasefire. Jo sets her sights on the leader of the Skedar, the high priest of the Battle Shrine, while Elvis returns to the assault ship to summon the Maian fleet.\n\nThe game finishes with the temple in ruins... Elvis calls for a lull in the bombardment so that he can find Joanna. She is alive, held under a pile of rubble by a Skedar that grabbed her foot before she could get clear. Elvis lends her a gun to help convince the Skedar to let go, and they depart for orbit.\n",
